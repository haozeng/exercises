marqeta:

1, migration project
consumer core -> authorize.net
payment api -> authorize.net
migrate all payment consumer core to payment api
have environmental variables built in to turn on/off this feature in staging or production

2, merchant portal -> proxy server built
backbone.js application and it needs to talk with our consumer api and payment api
intead of using cross-domain ajax, we decided to use proxy server in merchant portal
because unlike our consumer api, the payment api that are unsecured, nothing like token based authentication
by having a proxy server, we allow those requests behind a firewall.


wink:

1, mass-zigbee feature -> group feature

zigbee/zwave
hub1/hub2
ge/philips/cree
light_bulb/lock

each device has a local_id associated with it in each hub

map devices in the hub to the devices in the server
server -> agent -> hub
hub -> agent -> server
hub_group_table: 
hub_id, hub_group_id, radio_type, manufacturer_device_model, device_id, device_type, members

2, admin-portal (authentication, impersonation)
talk about authentication and impersonation

in oauth specs,
first trial: authenticate as a app, using 'client_credential flows', bad, we need to change core apis
second trail: impersonate as the user, using access_token, refresh_token just like mobiles clients without chaning apis
and we save user authentication_token in memcacache per admin.

3, ifttt-project (triggers, actions)
